// you can use this file to add your custom webpack plugins, loaders and anything you like.
// This is just the basic way to add additional webpack configurations.
// For more information refer the docs: https://storybook.js.org/configurations/custom-webpack-config

// IMPORTANT
// When you add this file, we won't add the default configurations which is similar
// to "React Create App". This only has babel loader to load JavaScript.

      extensions: [".ts", ".tsx", ".js", ".json"]
  },

  externals: {
    "react": "React",

        // All files with a '.ts' or '.tsx' extension will be handled by 'awesome-typescript-loader'.
        { test: /\.tsx?$/, loader: "awesome-typescript-loader" },

        // All output '.js' files will have any sourcemaps re-processed by 'source-map-loader'.

  // When importing a module whose path matches one of the following, just
  // assume a corresponding global variable exists and use that instead.
  // This is important because it allows us to avoid bundling all of our
  // dependencies, which allows browsers to cache those libraries between builds.
